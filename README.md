# pcb_111000_projects

My plan for pcb_111000 is to use it to introduce youngsters to the wonders
of C-programming for microcontrollers.  Hopefully in an after schoool club
or something similar.

Repository PCB-111000_V2 gives the details of the pcb HW and system code.
The purpose of this repository is simply to list the various project choices
in the order in which I plan to introduce them.
