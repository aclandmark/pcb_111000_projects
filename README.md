# pcb_111000_projects

My hope for pcb_111000 is that I will be able to use it to introduce youngsters 
to the wonders of C-programming for microcontrollers.  Possibly in an after 
schoool club or something similar.

Repository PCB-111000_V2 gives the details of the pcb HW and system code.
The purpose of this repository is simply to list the various project choices
in the order in which I might introduce them.
