/*
 Target practice:
 In this example a basic LED driver routine runs in the for ground.
 The user operates user switch SW2 to shoot the LEDs down.
 
 Note SW2 is connected to a pin on the Atmega328 that is configured as input.
 When SW2 is pressed the voltage level on the pin changes from 5V to zero volts.
 A Pin Change Interrupt (PCI) is generated.
