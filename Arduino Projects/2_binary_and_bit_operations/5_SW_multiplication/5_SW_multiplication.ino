/*
 Binary multiplication is simply a process of shift and add
 For details see
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/binary-multiplication/


Multiplication can also be achieved by adding the multiplicand to
itself as many times as the multiplier, but this process is relatively slow.

For example 2 x 3 is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
